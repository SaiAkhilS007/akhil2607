# What exactly is big data?

Big data is data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the three Vs.

In common words, Big data contains of large, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources from all types of media these days. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software like RDMS just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.

Some of the famous examples of Big Data are **Healthcare, Transportation, Smart Cities Infrastructure, Sports, Media and Entertainment.**

### Types of Big Data

#### Structured Data
Structured data is stored in a record's set field. We utilize this information everyday. like your name and place. It's schemas connect all data, so it has the same features. You may call structured data as linked data. For data consistency, it is separated across many tables with one record per object. Table limitations ensure relationship success. Structured data helps firms maximize their data analysis tools and methodologies. 
Examples are **Databases such as Oracle, MySQL and Spreadsheets.**

#### Semi-Structured Data
It is also called as NoSQL data because it is not bound to any RDMS schemas for data storage or handling. It is also not organized into raws and columns like spreadsheets. This contains the information which is came from the external resources such as social meida platforms like facebooks or web-based data feeds like twitter or news channels. A data serialization language is used to exchange semi-structured data across systems and also store metadata about a business process but it can also include files containing machine instructions for computer programs.
Examples are **E-mails, Audio, Zip Files, XML and JSON.**

#### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data lacks a schema or rules. Its setup is random. Unstructured data includes photos, videos, text, and log files. The data behind a picture or video is unstructured, even if the metadata is semi-structured. Without the right software, unstructured data is called “dark data” since it cannot be examined.                                                                                                               
Examples are **Videos, Text Messages, Chats, Webpages and images.**
